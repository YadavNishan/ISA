                <h3>Qur Lent</h3>
                <img src="image5.jpg">
                <p>By David Crumm <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The annual observance of Lent, the season of spiritual reflection leading to Easter, is growing across the U.S. Around the world, 2 billion men and women mark Lent as a part of the Christian calendar, but most do not pause on a daily basis to enjoy Lentâ€™s rich opportunity to reflect on the life of Jesus. In growing numbers, though, Americans are finding this season attractive, because Lent taps into the deep spiritual yearnings in our culture and, at the same time, encourages individual expression. Our Lent is a 40-day, 40-chapter invitation to enjoy that combination of faith and self-guided reflection. The book was written by award-winning religion writer David Crumm, the founding editor of ReadTheSpirit online magazine and publishing house.</li>

                <h3>RichDad PoorDad</h3>
                <img src="image6.jpg" >
                <p>By Robert T. Kiyosaki <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates the importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ). Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life.[1] The titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security.</li>
